Tomato Leaf Disease Detection

## Description
This project is developed as part of the **7th Semester academic project**.  
It detects **tomato leaf diseases** using images and machine learning techniques.

The system takes a tomato leaf image as input and predicts the disease present in the leaf.
# Project Files
- `app.py` – Main application file
- `Model_Training.ipynb` – Model training notebook
- `Dataset/` – Tomato leaf image dataset
- `README.md` – Project information

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning / Deep Learning
- Image Processing
- Jupyter Notebook
- Flask

## Dataset
The dataset contains tomato leaf images with diseases such as:
- Bacterial Spot  
- Early Blight  
- Late Blight  
- Leaf Mold  
- Yellow Leaf Curl Virus  
- Mosaic Virus  


## How to Run the Project
1. Install required Python libraries  
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
Upload a tomato leaf image to get the prediction
